About Traverse

Traverse is an identity resolution company helping marketers go beyond their active list, and engage in-market consumers within the email channel. It’s no secret that email is a highly effective communication tool for marketers to reach their active subscribers. Our aspirations for email are much bigger.

We enable marketers to reach people via email whom they currently have no means to do so, including:

Real-time identity resolution for anonymous website visitors

Former customers who are in-market again for their products

Identifying new customers who are in-market for products across the web

Founded by the same team that started and sold LeadSpend to Experian.

About the Position

The Traverse team is looking for a software engineer to help grow and maintain our existing products, and innovate into new areas. At its core, this position will revolve around working as part of our core development team to build out our evolving product offerings. We are a small and agile company, and put a high premium on the ability to work independently to achieve a goal.

We each wear many hats, and this role is no exception. Depending on the experience of the candidate, this role may expand to include additional responsibilities such as managing a development team, administering our stack in production, and maintaining our product roadmap and associated backlog.

The position will be located in Seattle, but full-time remote will be considered for the right candidate. Salary will range from $65,000 to $100,000 depending on experience.

As a future Software Engineer at Traverse, you are:

Well organized and self-motivated

An excellent developer, able to write efficient and clean code and maintain tests

Able to work both independently and as part of a team

A critical thinker, able to understand how technologies fit together and identify issues

Developing code for Traverse’s core products and ensuring all code is well tested

Interpreting user stories into technical needs and acceptance criteria

Reviewing pull requests and merging to our main code branch

Monitoring the platform production deploys

Contributing to deployment infrastructure (Jenkins and various automation)

Qualifications:

Excellent technical written and verbal communication skills

Excellent understanding of JavaScript, NodeJS, and Git

Experience building RESTful APIs, especially in Express and related frameworks

Experience in software architecture and design, especially with web applications and distributed systems

Experience working with data on a large scale, and an understanding the challenges it presents

Experience with network infrastructure, especially in AWS

Concrete Skills:

Node.js. Experience with Node Streams, Express.js, and Promises required.

AWS. Experience with Cloudformation, DynamoDb, Cloudwatch, SQS, and SWF desired.

SQL. Experience with AWS RDS, MySql, and/or PrestoDb desired.
